## The Return

Since social media is falling apart I decided to resurrect this blog. A lot of the older content may not be something I identify with anymore, but I didn't want to purge the history of it

This is a collection of personal writings from 2012 forward, everything before it was all on LiveJournal and is lost to the ages.

## OK, But What About You?

Ah! I am Ame, or Ms. D.O.S. in furry circles.

I am a furry, an avid reader, a game master, and a musician. However my career is in what we call, DevOps.

I absolutely love computers and technology, yes even when they are being jerks. I primarily use Linux or macOS depending on the context.
