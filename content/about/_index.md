title: Because Life is Too Awesome Not to Share
---

Welcome to my proverbial corner of the internet, or one of them.
I am Ame, or Ms. D.O.S. in furry circles.

I am a furry, an avid reader, a game master, and a musician.
However my career is in DevOps, or as I think of it, Linux nerding with a big splash of programming.

I absolutely adore computers and technology, yes even when they are being jerks. I tend not to be too fanatical or tie my identity to any piece of technology or company anymore and this allows me to both be way too distracted by being into too many things but also see when something is better for a certain use case.

## Dumb Quick Fun Facts

- I am a recovering meme junkie.
- I do computering for a career, and I really love computering.
- I primarily use Linux or macOS depending on the context.
- Totally addicted to music; others and my own. I would consider music "what I do" but not for a living.
- I really like lists! (Virgo)
- Any pony can be your best pony but we all know Trixie is best pony.
- I practice witchcraft.
- I tried to be a Gamer™ but failed to get my Gamer™ license twice and gave up.
    - …so I switched to reading, I read a LOT of books.
    - My most read genres are romance and popsci.
- I like to say I am a Rarity but we all know that's probably a lie.
- I watch anime as it airs (current season), mostly the shoujo/josei.
- I am enough of a computer nerd to have nuanced opinions on things like editors, types of window managers, software packaging/deployment, and programming languages.
    - But I know that said opinions all are based on my use case and needs; it's a good thing if you prefer something different because diversity is good for the ecosystem and is an accessibility issue.
- I care a lot about social justice issues like equity and accessibility. I am more of a social justice white mage sub red though. _(that is a Final Fantasy XI joke)_
