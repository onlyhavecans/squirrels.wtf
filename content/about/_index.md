title: Because Life is Too Awesome Not to Share

Since social media is falling apart I decided to resurrect this blog. A lot of the older content may not be something I identify with anymore, but I didn't want to purge the history of it

This is a collection of personal writings from 2012 forward, everything before it was all on LiveJournal and is lost to the ages.
