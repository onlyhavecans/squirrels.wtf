This week in squirrels...

<!--more-->

## Summary

- low energy
  - Sunday, I was hoping to be so productive, but then after my stream, I got stuck, and I didn't even post my blog!
  - Things did not pick up energy-wise because of the following tasks
- Underwater at work
  - After taking the week after the summit off, I came back to tonnes and tonnes to catch up on… but sadly not enough on the project I was working on.
  - I ended up having to take two days to do massive refactoring and fixes to get the project back to where we wanted it over a week ago.
- Bandcamp Friday!
  - I have so many albums I have wanted to buy in the last two days, but NOOOOOOOOOO it's Bandcamp Friday this week, and I have to wait with great anticipation!
  - It reminded me of having to go out to the record store or Hot Topic and find your stuff for a month or so.
- Freaking Framework
  - Seriously, what is it with them and shipping? After my laptop arrived in mid-November, I immediately placed an order for more RAM and some additional modules. 5 business days with expedited shipping has turned into 15 business days and dead silence.
  - Of course, now ram prices have blown up in the last week, so I assume they decided to silently never ship my order because they can resell my order for way more while never actually acknowledging the money I already gave them.
  - After emailing them, they told me they have to escalate it, but the escalation team is all out for two weeks (in December), so…. the heck?

## Books

- I Wanna Be Your Girl Vol 1 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - A book about trans experience and queer friendship building that I rated five stars? Yep. This first book is perfect: sound art, amazing, well-informed stories. Feel good with the pains? Yes.
- I Wanna Be Your Girl Volume 2 ⭐⭐⭐
  - I took a whole star off because the ebook version of this is misprinted, so all the pages are arranged backwards, making it a pain to read
  - The story is also more fragmented as we pull in a lot of characters. Some of them don't feel as well-written as the initial cast. But overall, there is still some absolutely amazing character development from the now leading quartet of girls.

## Music

I didn't listen to much new music because Bandcamp Friday was coming up, halting music sales for me for a few weeks.

- Danny Brown's Stardust
  - I have been lost in how good this is
- spellcasting
  - Still into this fun and goofy
- Vylet Pony's Monarch of Monsters
  - Somebody recommended this to me, and I expected some underground EBM or hyperpop. Still, I ended up with this huge rock album full of experimental and heavy story elements, and I was blown away. This one is a shocker of how deep and powerful it is. I am legit shocked this hasn't blown up more.

## Reads and Videos

- [Which Dispatch Characters Can Say 🚬? #dispatch #shorts #rpg #gamer - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naW2vbHKJvI)
  - It is all correct
- [how to *quickly* escape a dopamine hole - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXQ3VVRuy1I)
  - I have been in a bad dopamine hold

- [Building the PERFECT Linux PC with Linus Torvalds - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfv0V1SxbNA)
  - It seems everybody this week is quoting SOMETHING from this Linus^2 video, so I watched it.
  - Something that jumped out at me is something I preach a lot. Both Linus say early in the video that they never use the *latest* hardware, but always buy at least one gen back, including all the video editor workstations at LTT. And I feel this is so extra important for Linux.
  - Also, the push back on "in ram ECC" in DDR5 and how he won't use a system without ECC for the same reasons, stability, and RAM degradation.
