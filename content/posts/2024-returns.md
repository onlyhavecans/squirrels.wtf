Oh wow. I haven't written in my blog since the pandemic hit.

_Yikes._

A lot has happened since then.

With social media having fallen apart for years I thought I would spend some time to build this blog back up.

I am going to try to spend more time adding smaller things to it, and putting more notes up here instead of only in my Obsidian document.

It's going to be a rough next four years, might as well spend it contributing.

It's been years and the last time I wrote here I was using Hugo 0.80, sadly it is now at 0.138 and I have had to redo a shocking amount of code. It's outright frustrating I needed to replace the theme and tonnes of code changes.

I also have noticed that old blog posts are pretty poor quality, but many of them are 12 years old and I am not interested in cleaning them all up... _yet_
