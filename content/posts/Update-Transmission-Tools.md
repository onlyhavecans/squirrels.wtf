title: Update to my Transmission Tools
tags: [python, bittorrent]

Nope, not something to help unmount and flush your transmissions, it's some tools for [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/), specifically MY tools.

I just though I would share that I redid this repository completely and cleaned up the Move & Stop script to cover some possible bugs and be a bit more python modern. If you had any problems with it not moving single files or just wanted some slightly cleaner code go grab the new version.

I should really break out TransmissionRequestWrapper into it's own package and distribute that since it's so sweet. Please feel free to use it with some credit.
