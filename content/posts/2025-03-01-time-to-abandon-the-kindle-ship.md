I have a confession to make, a weird confession. I am a kindle junkie. Oh how I love my kindle. I have thousands books purchased through amazon's kindle store. I read my kindle every day for hours.

I don't stream music, tv, or movies, I buy direct wherever I can online. I don't shop questionable big box when I have alternatives (and oh boy do I have them). I don't tiktok, or facebook, or twitter. I run linux where I can. I buy my ttrpg games through indie distributors even, direct from crowdsource if possible. I don't use google, I self host, I pay for a service over ads. I do a lot to try and be as reasonably ethical of a consumer as possible.

But amazon books? That is my _thing_.

It's convient and fun and easy. I can buy any book at any time right from my kindle. And it's there whenever I need it. The reading status is flawlessly synced in case I want to catch up on my phone for a bit or read comics on my iPad. It has _almost_ everything. I mean except for that one thing you just brought up.

I have _thousands_ of amazon leased books.

But lately I think I have to give up my creature comfort.

## Wait but Amazon is Good for You Actually

Believe it or not It's actually an article for _not_ leaving Amazon's platform that ended up being the stray that broke the camels back.
