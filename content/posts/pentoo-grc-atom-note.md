Not a big blog, but a quick problem I got solved on IRC that I thought might help others.

I have a Gateway LT4009u with an Atom N2600. It's my "hacker/workshop" laptop. The atom N processors are a bit gimpy so sometimes things don't run right.
One thing is GNURadio on Pentoo. Pentoo runs hardened and this pisses off the Atom N.<!--more-->

So if you get the following error.

```bash
LLVM ERROR: Allocation failed when allocating new memory in the JIT
Can't Allocate RWX Memory: Operation not permitted
```

Then you need to soft disable hardened with the following command

```bash
sudo toggle_hardened
```

I hope that helps anyone else on the internet.

Thanks to Zero_Chaos in #pentoo on irc.freenode.net for the fix (and pentoo)

Quick Update: This also happens when running in VirtualBox 5 on my 2015 MacBook i7, but the fix is the same
