This post is written in mourning. Today I lost one of the most colorful humans in my life. Steph was absolutely the most amazing, delightful, and powerful women I have had the opportunity to love.

Since the early 2000's with all those nights at nightclubs, to the nearly decade as partners, to her help with my transition, she has changed my life for the better over and over and over.

Part of me wants to go on about all her amazing charity with with the group she created Very Awesome Girls Into Nerdy Activities (yes, V.A.G.I.N.A lol), her time with activism, or all the things she taught me, all the troubles we overcame together, and all the smiles we shared.

When people pass away we often talk about who they were to us individually but I wanted to take a moment to talk about who she was to everybody.

- She was more powerful than you could even imagine.
- She was incredibly passionate about whatever had her interests.
- She always wanted to help others around her and do goode.
- She had been through things that could humble most of us.
- She created a whole local charity and social group around her.
- She was an amazing witch
- She was an amazing dancer, even right after knee surgury
- She was the biggest nerd I know

I have so much more I could write but it's still hard to. Maybe some other time I will come back and write more, but for now what I want to share most is her smile. Because it was the best one in the world.

I hope this can be a lil memorial to everything she was for us all.
