For those that don't know I'm a Chef for a living. Not the kind that works with food but one that works with code.
What you may not know is I'm a FreeBSD guy, or at least claim to be one.
I've been building a new FreeBSD workstation and discovered that there is no chef-dk for FreeBSD.
Building it isn't bad, but there is a trick to it.

So without further ado, here is building Chef-DK for FreeBSD 10.3 (and probably most >=10.0)

If this is a fresh box you need pkg, ports, and some base packages.
All this assumes run as root.

```bash
pkg install pkg
portsnap fetch extract
portsnap fetch update
pkg install sudo
```

Ok, for the rest of this I am assuming you are running as a user that has sudo rights.
If you aren't then ymmv.

```bash
sudo pkg install ruby rubygem-bundler portdowngrade git
cd ~
sudo portdowngrade devel/gecode r345033
cd gecode
sudo make deinstall install clean
sudo sed -ie 's/\(#define GECODE_VERSION_NUMBER\)\s*/\1 300703/' /usr/local/include/gecode/support/config.hpp
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/chef/chef-dk.git
cd chef-dk
USE_SYSTEM_GECODE=1 bundle install --without development
```

There you go! It's not going to give you the /opt/chef-dk omnibus but you will have all the chef-dk you need to do your stuff!
Maybe later I'll document how to make a package but this will likely work for me.

UPDATE 2017-01-17: Thanks to [Shawn](https://shawnwilsher.com/) for the GECODE_VERSION_NUMBER update. This was broken several months after this post initally was written
