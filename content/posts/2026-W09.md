This week in squirrels...

## Summary

- Made my Own Art Gallery in Hugo
    - This was on my laundry list of things to try out for a while. With all the changes around layouts and short codes in hugo in the new versions I wanted to take the shot.
    - I based the theme off of a friend's gallery software and the theme I use for my blog to save myself from doing too much design work. Overall Hugo made it pretty easy to make something that had the base features I wanted and keep iterating on it.
    - It was a big win, and using Hugo as the engine gets me a lot of niceties for free and allows me to use the same build pipeline style I use for all my other Hugo sites.
- New tool for remote deploys
    - While I was at it I made a webhook runner so I can remotely trigger deploys and other commands on my server.
    - This isn't a unique or new tool; there are a few other tools out there, but I'm not new to making quick Go apps, and I thought it would be good to have Claude critique my code to hell and help security check my work.
- Upgrading OPNSense.
    - I have been holding off on the 25.7 to 26.1 upgrade and finally took the plunge.
    - Luckily, I already took the pain of moving to KEA, so the upgrade and uninstall of ISC wasn't bad.
- The Crashout™
    - This week has been the worst for mental health. I thought it was bad the last few weeks, and then this week hit, and I am perpetually on the edge of a tantrum the likes you have never seen
    - And it's not just me. My bestie `A` and their partner have also been on the brink, and I got a message that somebody close is entering temporary mental care
- New Meds New Sick
    - Oh, yay! Having vision issues with my meds changes.

## Books

- Boyfriend Sometimes Girlfriend Volume 1 ⭐⭐⭐
    - This is yet another take at gender benders and while it didn't jump into the weird horny tropes it also felt a bit awkward all around. Also with only three chapters and a lot of time dwelling on the art and scenery it was **way** too short to get a feel for all the characters they were introducing.
- Boyfriend Sometimes Girlfriend Volume 2 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - I tried out volume two and while it still suffered from being too short for how much the manga spends exploring it's art, the B couple shined really well and we got a lot more feeling for everybody. Also there is a bunch of yuri/gl fanservice in an interesting way
- How Do I Turn My Best Friend Into My Girlfriend Vol 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - Amazing ending that doesn't take too much time in its victory laps, but has a really satisfying conclusion. Overall, this series is probably one of the best friends-to-lovers manga I have read recently.
- My Girlfriend's Not Here Today Vol 6 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
    - I think this is the best book of the series so far. Everyone is still a drama mess, but everyone's motivations feel very clear and realistic, even when the main character's is just that she loves a mess. If you don't mind the nature of the story, it's getting good.

## Music

- Lady Gaga's "MAYHEM"
    - I needed a throwback to one of last year's top albums for me. Something feel good.
- Mandy, Indiana's "URGH"
    - This is a "new to me" band, and their latest album is really good. It's the kind of hard genre-defying bits. Some industrial, some noise, some punk.
- Peaches "No Lube So Rude"
    - I am still keeping this in rotation. These new Peaches is fantastic.
- Gorillaz' "The Mountain"
    - I've never been the biggest Gorillaz fan, but this one really hits. All the themes of loss and death, along with the Indian sounds and influences, really hit home. I haven't had much time with this, but it's good so far.
- Friends&'s "folx."
    - This came in as a Bandcamp recommendation, and when I need something less deep and more chaotic fun, this is there for it.
