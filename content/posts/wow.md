Another new site, another clean slate ready to be filled with so much information!

I will try to make this site as little about the drivel, porn, rage, and trolls that the rest of the internet seems to amuse itself about. This site is going to be all about the things that really interest me.
Currently those things are Fiction, Writing, Technology, writing fiction, and Productivityâ€¦ There also may be stuff about glitchy painful music and podcasts.

My old site is archived safe and while most of the old links may be gone feel free to check it out. It highlights one of the busiest and most externally exciting period of my life where photography and music production was every facet of my life.
You can also feel free to ask questions if you really care. I don't expect this site to get too much traffic.
