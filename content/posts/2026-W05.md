This week in squirrels...

<!--more-->

## Summary

- Supporting Other Musicians: Helping Senpai
    - A music artist I really like asked me to review the mix on some of his new tracks. It made me squee. It was really great to listen and offer feedback, amateurish as it is.
- Personal Creativity and Music Urges: Overdue for a song
    - Because of the above and a lot of angst boiling up in me, I have been feeling the urge to spend a lot more time making music. I will have to make the time, maybe dedicate a day.
- Brain no worky
    - The week is starting with no focus or desire to get things done
- NixOS refactors
    - Since things have settled, I am taking the time to do some refactors and see if I can get to better patterns I can share.
    - I tried a lot to do the dendritic pattern, but couldn't make it stick.
- Blogging Shift
    - Since I have been feeling stuck on some of the final music posts and technically am doing research on the portable audio player, I decided to switch
    - Yes, I am finally jumping over to the NixOS blog post series and am working on a few posts in tandem at the moment.
- Tech Issues and Troubleshooting: iOS and IPv6
    - The AppleTV once again started throwing up IPv6 announcements declaring a gateway and screwing up my network. Freaking apple is blowing me up and pissing me off so much.
- Creative Tech Experiments
    - I wanted to make my own tangea, and I discovered Motion Capture for making this simple animation in Typescript. It seemed a bit intimidating, but actually ended up being really quick for me!
    - Photopea also ended up helping so much for quick editing assets for it, I even subscribed for a year. It was enough to get me to uninstall gimp and Krita.

## Books

- ONIMAI I'm Now Your Sister! 10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
    - This milestone volume has all the major bits making a comeback (for better or worse), seven bonus chapters, and a fun self-referential 100's chapter with silly service. For A victory lap of a volume, it is well done. I'm still displeased with some of the content in this manga, but it doesn't cross any further lines.
- Theres No Freaking Way Ill be Your Lover! Unless... (Light Novel) Vol. 5 ⭐️⭐️
    - I read this book in 2024, and I cannot remember any of the romantic plot lines from this book or how the previous' book (anime end) cliffhanger is resolved, so I decided to go back and re-read it. I was reminded why I don't remember most of it. It's filler that resolves nothing.

## Music

- Haujobb's "The Machine in the Ghost"
    - Oddly enough, I was never that huge of a Haujobb fan, but when "The Machine in the Ghost" stopped in 2024, I was a convert. This album hits me hard and deep, while not even being super harsh
- Lyra Pramuk's "Hymnal"
    - I have been getting more and more into Lyra's work. I discovered her right when her first album came out, and even though I feel so much of the Björk influence, the first album didn't stick. The remix and her second album last year are working for me more
- Monasterium Imperi's "Churchtek Files"
    - I don't know what churchtek was before this, but this newer, more glitch sound from the normally ambient droning music from Monasterium Imperi gets me
- Primus' "Tales From the Punchbowl"
    - Due to jokes about a game that has the god Primus, I started listening to all of my Primus catalog again, this album is still my favorite though.
- Gary Numan's "Dead Son Rising"
    - This album has me stuck again. I repeat, this is Gary Numan's version of The Fragile, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible.
- Razed in Black's "Shrieks, Laments and Anguished Cries"
    - Cleopatra is re-releasing Razed In Black's back catalog, and it's gotten me listening to my favorite band from the early 2ks.

Amazon's cuts come amid the trend of what some have called the "[forever layoff](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/16/rolling-layoffs-small-firings), where reductions come in batches, rather than a single sweeping reorganization."
