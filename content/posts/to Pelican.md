title: Now with less dynamics

I've been stalling a lot on writing this post. I guess I wanted everything to be perfect by the time I actually wrote about it however my willpower to finish these test cases is weak.

The site has now changed, yet again. I decided not to wait 5 years between refreshes this time.

The biggest change people should notice is at first glance you shouldn't notice change. When you click around it should be easy to realize that the site isn't WordPress based anymore though. I've switched over to [Pelican](http://pelican.notmyidea.org/en/2.8/index.html). The project still feels very young and small, but it's done in python and the developers are very active and open to submissions so I jumped in.

It's took some wiggling around to get into it, and lots of bashing on my old chunk theme to get it to look perfect in Pelican but in the end I really like the fact I did a lot of back end work to the system. I submitted my theme to the official [Theme's repo](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) and am currently working on adding in several features of my own to the projectâ€¦ and by several I mean I have a to-do list longer than most any of my own software by far.
