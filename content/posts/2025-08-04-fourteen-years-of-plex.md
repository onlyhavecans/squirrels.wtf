Dang, when I wanted to write this article I opened up my plex account and they told me I have had this account with them since 2011.

I am almost sure I have been a Plex Pass Lifetime member for just as long. in fact in the early 10's I used to give out Plex Pass Lifetimes for XMAS gifts. Oh I was so angry when they remove the ability to gift a Lifetime Plex Pass.
