Correct!

Wow. No, not happening. I still have it all backed up but I think all that old content will stay back there. I am currently trying to set this up so I can post my mostly private journal here as well as posting public news and information. LJ will not be getting 100% of the content I post, but it still will get some updates.
The dawn of handpicked RSS content and feeds has consumed community and "friend based" feeds and for the most part I think we are better for it. I'm getting on the ship.
