This week in squirrels...

<!--more-->

## Summary

- Showstopper Failure at work
    - Things went really badly at work. A worst-case kinda thing where the whole nomad cluster ate itself due to a hot-trash bug. And due to a series of poor choices it took down everything for a deeply unacceptable amount of time.
    - We had a full recovery with no data loss, but we had to rebuild the world.
    - As you can imagine, we have now stopped the world and are auditing all procedures, processes, and disaster recovery.
    - This has meant long days spent addressing every gap and challenge that has emerged out of this, and some more fresh we have found.
- Crashing out after work
    - I canceled all my streams and have mostly been watching a bit of tv and wishing I could hack on some stream stuff, but my energy and desire to code things have been wiped at the moment.
    - I accomplished very little reading or writing.
- Four hours on Tyler Perry
    - I watched a four-hour-long video on Tyler Perry and Black media. It was actually worth it.
- Dusting off the decks
    - I am doing some DJing and hosting for a friend's wedding. It is already a little stressful to prep and get it all ready, but getting to help one of my besties on her day is so worth it.

## Books

- Rainbows After Storms Vol 8 ⭐⭐⭐
    - This volume was more enjoyable than the last two because it wasn't constant chapters of them fighting over nothing. Despite this, the series still feels stalled. Eight volumes of virginal blushes and eyes feel less like slow burn and more repetitive and regressive.

## Music

- KMFDM's Enemy
    - I am still getting used to the new sound
- Jérôme Chassagnard's "Hora Fugit"
    - Brand new album by a favorite of mine for "chill industrial."
- EFF DST's "incarnate."
    - For some reason, every time I listen to Chassagnard, I want to listen to the slightly harder EFF DISS
- Snog's "Dear Valued Customer"
    - I listened to this through a whole major incident and the next three days on loop.
- Ashnikko's "Smoochies" & "Weed Killer"
    - Sometimes I just need to tap my yandere bisexual disaster energy. And this is it.

## Reads and Videos

- [Verification debt is the AI era’s technical debt – Kevin Browne](https://www.kevinbrowne.ca/verification-debt-is-the-ai-eras-technical-debt/)
    - This is so real. We have been seeing this at work with our security inbox, and I assume it's going to get even worse as more people rely on AI.
    - I like that this article goes so far past just technical, though, and is in everything we look at now.
    - I feel like the article misses the most apt comparison of email SPAM. Email's biggest flaw is that its cost to generate and send is a fraction of what it costs to process it, both technically and also by the people who receive it. And therefore, flooding people with low-quality content has led to the undervaluing and reduced use of email, since you have to wade through it.
    - Now, AI is making it so the cost of generating low-quality and possibly problematic content is ultra-low EVERYWHERE.
    - What is interesting to me is that GitHub has decided to chip in and talk about how they are trying to address that, so this isn't a random blog post about this either [Welcome to the Eternal September of open source. Here's what we plan to do for maintainers. - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/welcome-to-the-eternal-september-of-open-source-heres-what-we-plan-to-do-for-maintainers/)
- [Debian Linux Is Going Through A Crisis - Brodie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldoHviThNqQ)
    - I have seen a few articles about this, but Brodie does a good summary of a lot of things I have been seeing. All of these are smaller issues combined, but together they seem that Debian is facing some severe structural issues, as Gen X and even some Elder Millennials are aging out of the copious spare time and energy to work on this project that has not been modernized in 15 years.
    - I think it is _embarrassing_ that Canonical hasn't supported the downstream at all, especially for things like GDPR help when they have people they pay for that.
- ['The Most Dejected I’ve Ever Felt:' Harassers Made Nude AI Images of Her, Then Started an OnlyFans](https://www.404media.co/grok-nudify-ai-images-impersonation-onlyfans/)
    - This is the kinda stuff that shakes my faith in people.
- [Anthropic says Claude could be misused for "heinous crimes" like chemical weapons](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/anthropic-claude-safety-chemical-weapons-values)
    - Clearly, this will not go wrong. /s
- [AI slows down open source developers. Peter Naur can teach us why.](https://johnwhiles.com/posts/mental-models-vs-ai-tools)
    - another decent AI programming thought piece
- [Did Bad Bunny "Out Woke" Kendrick? - F.D. Signifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXHxO81kXZw)
    - The term "gatchastapo" needs to be used and known everywhere now
- [Discord Voluntarily Pushes Mandatory Age Verification Despite Recent Data Breach | Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/02/discord-voluntarily-pushes-mandatory-age-verification-despite-recent-data-breach)
    - Discord is making big mistakes.
- [Microsoft’s AI-Powered Copyright Bots Fucked Up And Got An Innocent Game Delisted From Steam | Techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/12/microsofts-ai-powered-copyright-bots-fucked-up-and-got-an-innocent-game-delisted-from-steam/)
    - and I doubt they will do anything to compensate the engineers and teams who they impacted, in fact, they will just keep harming others.
