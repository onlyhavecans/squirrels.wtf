Welcome to a brand new series of posts.

This blog started as the continuation of my LiveJournal, and I am returning to my roots for this series. I miss blogging my thoughts. This blog went pretty quiet after Twitter really took off, but after the great Eloning of X I never fully took to Mastodon or BlueSky.

My goals are both to post regularly to get back up the habits and build workflows for better blogging while also sharing a summarized short-form recap of my week.
This won't become the sole purpose of my blog. I am really hoping to use this as a springboard for regular posts on all sorts of topics.

A lot of this is modeled after two other people I have seen do this.

My format will grow and change over time, but it's mostly going to be as follows:

```markdown
## Summary

- list of things that have come up
- and thoughts

## Books

- Books
- Manga

## Music

- Music news
- Music I'm buying
- w/e

## Posts

- Sharing articles
- or videos
- the repost corner
```

I may miss a few weeks when things come up, but I hope you will stick with it.
Also I hope I stick with it too ðŸ¤£
