title: Jumping Onto the Uses Bandwagon

Another quick update for the website!

While reading some articles about [how to do cool stuff with sqlc](https://brandur.org/fragments/sqlc-2024) I found yet another "Uses" page where the blogger shows off their list full of favorite tools and toys.

Since I like to share cool tips and toys and tricks I thought i would make one too, now in the [Uses Section](/uses) of the sidebar.

Mine isn't as nice as [this one](https://brandur.org/uses), but I aspire to get it to that point eventually. Check it out if you want to know what cool stuff I am into these days.
