Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X"

…

Yep, that's the whole post. The entire reason I host my own music server and buy all my own music is because of Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X."

…

Ok that's not a very good blog post, so let's wind it back.

## The Beginning

I am, supposedly, not a young woman. I get compliments to the otherwise but I remember now incredibly brown everything was in the 80's, the massive shoulder pads and frosted tips of the 90's, the beginning of the meme era of the 00s, when they changed the the aspect ratio of tv in the 10's and the snapback post pando era of the 20's.

I am, as they say.. from the 1900's.

You might be saying now… So what? Well…

Music is a universal constant that transcends generations. But something that isn't universal is where and how we listen to it. Not to be too much of old lady yells at cloud, but I'm not a big fan of the current way that the kids now adays enjoy music.

Back in my days we bought entire albums, or sometimes singles if you were hardcore. If you wanted to discover new music you had the radio to hear what was popular.[^1] Then we got MTV and we could watch music and it was amazing. They also gave us Daria which was just amazing.

[^1]: It wasn't until much later in life I realized that what was played on the radio was popular mostly because they were promoted and played heavily on the radio, less the other way around.

## Reason 1: All the Music from the Before Times

I have so much music. I have albums from nobody groups I got at a show, I have while labels and demos from when I was a DJ. I have stacks of CDs from indie labels that are long gone. I have music friends have made, I have music that I have played. I have albums from a shoe box of albums i don't even know where they came from. I have music that has been changed and redone over time

None of those will ever ever ever be on streaming on platforms. When I used Apple Music with iTunes Match it at least let me sync my music so I could listen to both at once, but it was clear Apple was interested in phasing that out.

## Reason 2: My Preferred way to Listen to Music

I prefer to listen to music album by album and artist by artist in a fairly intentional way. You _can_ do that on Apple Music and Spotify, but that's not really what they give you is it? They give you all these computer generated playlists all based on what they think you want to listen to, or they want you to listen to.

I am not saying that music discovery systems are bad, but I feel like the Sugar High ADHD approach to music doesn't help me sink into and really hear all the details of an album… which leads to…

## Reason 3: Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X", Or, I Was just Listening to That, Where Did it Go?

It always comes back to Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X." This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I was listening to the album on loop on Apple Music and then the next morning… it was gone.

I moved on but later came back to Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X" and put it on loop again and… then two days later it was gone again.

I was losing my mind.

When you are streaming music content comes and goes as licencing deals change, and some albums pop on and off over and over it turns out. And that drove me batty enough to "go back to listening to music the old way."

## Reason 4: Streaming Giveth, Streaming Taketh away

I refuse to give streaming any credit for breaking down the legacy music industries hold on our access to music when in the late 90's we already had MP3.com helping find amazing indie artists and indie labels like Cleopatra and Crunch Pod lifting them and putting out CD and CDRs.

However when Apple made iTunes Music store it blew everybody away and made it mainstream. Then streaming made it… too easy?

Yes sadly now it's a bit too easy to push music up to streaming platforms and this is causing innumerable problems for artists. I think you can easily troll YouTube to find video after video to find people talking about the AI flood, the algorithms, the bots, the fraud, etc.

In fact some are considering this to be reaching a critical issue, and in order to avoid sharing a Rick Beato video[^2] I will instead share a Venus Theory one.

[^2]: I would never beat the old lady yells at cloud allegations at that point.

## Then what Do I Do?

1. Buy music
2. Don't lean into the AI playlists, listen intentionally
3. Do what makes you happy
