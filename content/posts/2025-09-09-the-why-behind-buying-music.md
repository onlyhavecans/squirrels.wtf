Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X"

…

Yep, that's the whole post. The entire reason I buy all almost every track of music I enjoy is because of Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X."

… Fine, that's not a very good blog post, so let's rewind.

## The Beginning

I am, supposedly, not a young woman. I get compliments on the otherwise, but I remember how incredibly brown everything was in the 80's, the massive shoulder pads and frosted tips of the 90's, the beginning of the meme era of the 00s, when they changed the aspect ratio of TV in the 10's, and the snapback post Pando era of the 20's.

I am, as they say, from the 1900s.

You might be saying… So what? Well…

While music is a universal constant that transcends generations, where and how we listen to it is not. At the risk of being the old lady yelling at the cloud, I'm not a big fan of participating in the cool new way to enjoy music.

Back in my days, we bought entire albums, or sometimes maxi-singles if you were hardcore on a band. If you wanted to discover new music, you had the radio to hear what was popular.[^1] Then we got MTV, and we could watch all the cool music. But still if you wanted to see or hear a specific thing you either needed to to to a store and spend about 15-30 bucks to have a single album or record songs off the radio onto tapes (then CD-Rs) to make curated, appx hour max playlist. Since it all took good money or effort, you had what you had and you often spent a lot of time with it. Either that or you just lived in one of the seven stations that everybody else in your town was listening to, that really played the same like, 100 songs over and over day after day anyways.

[^1]: It wasn't until much later in life that I realized that what was played on the radio was popular primarily because they were promoted and played heavily on the radio, rather than the other way around.

All that to bring up my following two points, starting with…

## Reason 1: All the Music from the before times

I have so much music, and not just popular cool major label music.

I have albums from various long forgotten local groups I got at a show
I have white label demos from when I was a DJ.
I have innumerable albums from indie industrial, goth, and noise labels that are long gone.
I have music friends have made.
I have music that I have made.
I have albums from a shoebox of CDs that I don't even know where they came from.
I have a bunch of silly fun tracks from myspace and the great meme music begining of the aughts.
I have music that has been changed and remade and re-released.

None of those will ever ever ever be on streaming platforms. When I used Apple Music with iTunes Match, it at least allowed me to sync my music, so I could listen to both together in a single interface but it was awfully buggy.

## Reason 2: My Preferred way to Listen to Music

I prefer to listen to music album by album and artist by artist in a fairly intentional way. You _can_ do that on streaming platforms, but that's not really what they give you, is it? They give you all these computer-generated playlists, all based on what they think you want to listen to, or they want you to listen to.

I am not saying that music discovery systems are bad, but I feel like the default Sugar High ADHD approach to music doesn't help me sink into and really hear all the details of an album… which leads to…

## Reason 3: Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X", Or, I Was Listening to That, where Did it Go?

It always comes back to Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X."

This was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I was listening to the album on loop on Apple Music and then the next morning… it was gone.

I moved on, but later came back to Sneaker Pimp's "Becoming X" and put it on loop again, and… then two days later it was gone again.

I was losing my mind.

Content comes and goes when you are streaming music. As licencing deals change some albums pop on and off over and over. That was the actual thing that drove me batty enough to decide that having access to all the music is not worth owning some files I can listen to whenever I want.

## Reason 4: Streaming Giveth, Streaming Taketh away (from Artists too)

I refuse to give streaming any credit for breaking down the legacy music industry's hold on our access to music. In the late 90s when napster was just starting to take off we already had MP3.com helping people find amazing indie artists and indie labels like Cleopatra and Crunch Pod lifting them and putting out CDs and CDRs. I still have a shocking amount of painfully low quality mp3.com files of creators long left the industry but I like what I like.

Then Apple decided to get involved and that's what took it from undergroud swell to zeitgeist I believe.

However it seems that streaming has made things worse for small artists?

Yes, it is now too easy to upload music to streaming platforms in the name of fraud, harassment, and spam. This causes numerous problems for artists. I think you can easily troll YouTube to find video after video to see people talking about the AI flood, the algorithms, the bots, the fraud, etc. In fact, some are considering this to be reaching a critical point.

To avoid sharing a Rick Beato video,[^2] I will instead share a Venus Theory one on this topic.

## Ok, When, what Should the Intrepid Reader Do?

1. Buy music
2. Listen intentionally to artists and albums.
3. Curate your own playlists and spent time with the music you enjoy.
4. Consider if any of this matters to you, then do what best aligns with _your_ goals.
