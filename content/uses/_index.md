title: Ame Uses...
---
This is a "uses" page, which lists the gear and software I use daily.
This is all based on the trend originating with [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) where you can see what all us nerds are using.

## Hardware

- NixOS mini pc lab
- Debian home server
- Mint work desktop
- macOS work Laptop
- macOS desktop for music
- Raspberry Pi for Pi-Hole
- A small army of Raspberry Pi for ~~PlexAmp~~ headless home audio
- Protectli for PfSense Firewall

## Making & Shipping Software

I am a very terminal based person, and like to have a portable configurations I use across many types of systems. You can check out my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/onlyhavecans/dotfiles)

- **Firefox**: I prefer to not use chrome based browsers
- **Homebrew/Linuxbrew**: No matter what Linux or macOS I use, I have access to all the latest cli tools. Homebrew has changed how I install most things.
- [**WezTerm**](https://wezterm.org/index.html): I wanted a powerful and fast terminal I can use on all OS. It's lua config is also great for having some dynamic changes between linux and macOS.
- **Zsh**: I keep trying to switch to fish but it's lack of shell expansions keeps driving me back.
- **NeoVim w/ [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)**: No matter how often I try to break into using VSCode I keep coming back to my fully terminal based setup. Check out my configs [here](https://github.com/onlyhavecans/neovim)
- **tmux**: All keyboard navigation
- **[Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)**: how I navigate and manage files.

### Languages & Tools

- **Golang**: It's not without it's flaws but multi-threading is lightweight, it is mostly strongly typed, and compiles down to a single binary that is easy to deploy
- **Rust**: A whole different set of tradeoffs but I love the typing in it, the lack of nil, and serde is so fun.
- **Bash & ZSH**: I write shell scripts constantly. If I type it, it can be scripted.
- [**Just**](https://just.systems/): I replaced all my makefiles with justfiles
- **PostgreSQL**: From work to Play and everything in between, my favorite DB engine. I can't go back to MySQL.
- **Python**: I wrote this for so many years it still pops up when I need to prototype something.
- **Ansible**: How I manage owning so many computers without manually configuring/
- **Chef-Infra & Ruby**: I mostly only write this for work now.

## Productivity & Notes

I still like to process my thoughts through writing. I have a discbound notebook customized with printable trackers and daily task & note pages. I also manage all of my projects and tasks with "basic" GTD-style lists over a heavyweight software system.

- **Discagenda Discbound discs (24mm daily notebook, 33mm archive)**: After trying out so many different discs the metal Discagenda ones are the smoothest page turn, look great, and are not too heavy.
- **Lined Letter 120gsm paper**: I know dot grid is in vogue but I still like lined sheets in a heavy paper for my daily tasks and notes.
- **Frienda Rolling Ball Pen 0.5mm**: These Japanese pens are super quick drying and have thicker & darker lines when writing quickly than my second favorite pen, the Sakura Micron PN. They do have a smidge of bleed though.
- **Kuru Toga Mechanical Pencil 0.5mm**: I never know if the rotating lead is much more than a gimmick but I really adore the feel of their lead more than far more expensive drafting pencils I have tried.
- **Zebra Mildliners**: Awesome Highlighters with little smear. I use these to make a quick bit of a "daily spread"
- **Post-it 100% Recycled Super Sticky Lined Notes**: These are the best sticky notes I can find and can be reused and moved daily for weeks.
- **[MyLifePlans Templates](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MyLifePlans)**: Elegant and useful printable templates for trackers and goal setting
- **Obsidian**: For notes I want to save for later, archives, logs, and reference materials I love this markdown based note taking with a git based plugin for private sync!
- [PomoFocus](https://pomofocus.io): A very basic pomodoro timer that has auto-progression, ticking, and very long and loud alerts. I don't use the tasks, just the timer.

- Ableton Live
- Touche
- Polyend Tracker+
- Roland SP-404Mk2
- Artura MicroFreak
- Eventide Blackhole
- ChaseBliss Blooper
- A big pile of cheap Amazon pedals

## Self Host Stack

I like to run most of my own software on my self host server in a big Docker Compose stack

- **Forgejo**: My Git + CI/CD + Renovate stack all at [OnlyHaveCans.Works](https://onlyhavecans.works)
- **~~Plex~~**: Deprecated. I will miss PlexAmp, but they have been sharing all the signs things are not well in Startup Land.
- **Navidrome**: The next evolution of my music collection, fiddly and needs good tagging, but it's very powerful.
- **Jellyfin**: Not as simple and easy to use as Plex for most, but works extremely well once I discovered a few config tricks and the Infuse iOS/Mac client.
- **Komga**: Hosting all of my Itch.io, Patreon, & DrivethruRPG books
- **Grocy**: Home maintenance & chore tracking
- **FreshRSS**: I never gave up on RSS, this is a recent transition from NewsBlur.
- **Readeck**: Really nice read it later article storage
- **NextCloud**: Hosting most my records and documents
- **Syncthing**: Syncronizing some misc files and settings
- **Wireguard**: Always a way back home

## Quality of Life

Some things just make my life that much more fun

- **Kindle Paperwhite Signature**: I miss the Oasis but the new Paperwhite Signature is _so blazing fast_. I read a lot, like ~100 books a year, so having a fast light e-reader and access to so many books is a solid tradeoff.
- **Aiko Edition [Yoyogi Messenger](https://chromeindustries.com/products/yoyogi-messenger)**: Chrome Industries made a huge purse. The Aiko edition spray paint and bunny theme makes me smile every time I look at it.
- **Steelcase Gesture Office Chair**: When work and play is both computer based, having a comfortable adjustable and ergonomic chair is a must for our health.
- **Shure SE215 Pro Wired Earbuds**: I went back to wired and have been so happy for it.
- **Bandcamp**: I don't run Bandcamp or anything, but I buy the majority of my music through it, and it's just a delightful experience for fans of music.

### Beverages

I often joke about how boring I am when it comes to beverages as I only care to drink water, coffee, & tea; but I put a lot of effort into what I drink.

- **RTIC 20oz Ceramic Lined Tumbler**: This large "starbucks style" straw tumbler helps me get down a lot of water.
- **St Anthony's Industries Cup**: A special ceramic cup designed to keep my coffee & tea hot for a long time without imparting taste
- **V60 02 Brewer**: I have a classic clear glass and Stardust purple from the Night Sky Series
- **Blue Bottle Flat Bottom Brewer**: It works better than I expected when used with their filters
- **Orea V4**: Did I need a newer flat bottom? No? but is it fun and makes for interesting brews with cheap filders? YES!
- **Hario Switch**: I didn't get this brewer until I started experimenting with funkier beans.
- **Fellow Stagg EKG Kettle**: Love it or hate it, it's the staple now
- **Comendante C40 v4**: As popular as it is expensive, but makes a fantastic cup of coffee.
- **Acaia Pearl Scale**: Honestly, I would buy a timemore if I had to replace this
- **Locally Roasted Coffee**: We have a lot of local roasters here!
- ~~white2tea~~: I am looking for a new way to get quality loose leaf tea without ordering directly from China due to changes in shipping. I will miss their "Natural Redhead" series.
