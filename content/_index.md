# Welcome to my Nest of Writings

This blog is a collection of personal writings from 2012 forward.
Everything before 2012 was posted on LiveJournal and is lost to the ages.

Please keep in mind that with a history of posts like this, the older content may not be something I identify or endorse anymore, but I have decided to keep it for posterity and history for now.

The largest volume of content is personal reflections and insights into technology and productivity.
