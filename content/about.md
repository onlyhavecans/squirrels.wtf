Welcome to my proverbial corner of the internet.

I am Ame the Squirrel, or Ms. D.O.S. in furry circles.

I am a furry, an avid reader, a game master, and a musician.
My career is in DevOps/Platform/SRE/SysOps, or, as I think of it, being so much of a Linux nerd that they pay to automate things.

I absolutely adore computers and technology; yes, even when they are being jerks. I tend not to be too fanatical or tie my identity to any piece of technology or company these days, which allows me to be excited about everything.

## Dumb Quick Fun Facts

- I am extremely a squirrel.
- I am a recovering meme junkie.
- I do computering for a career, and I really love computering.
- I primarily use Linux or macOS depending on the context.
- Totally addicted to music; others and my own. I would consider music "what I do" but not for a living.
- I really like lists! (Virgo)
- Any pony can be your best pony but we all know Trixie is best pony.
- I practice witchcraft.
- I tried to be a Gamer™ but failed to get my Gamer™ license twice and gave up..
  - …so I switched to reading, I read a LOT of books.
  - My most read genres are romance, popsci, & social issues.
- I like to say I am a Rarity but we all know that's probably a lie.
- I watch anime as it airs (current season), mostly the shoujo/josei.
- I am enough of a computer nerd to have nuanced opinions on things like editors, window managers, software packaging/deployment, and programming languages.
  - But I know that said opinions all are based on my use case and needs; it's a good thing if you prefer something different because diversity is far more important than 'correctness' for the health of ecosystems, including tech ones.
- I play a cartoon spider on Twitch as a hobby.
- I care a lot about social justice issues like ethics, equity, and accessibility. I am more of a social justice white mage sub red though. _(that is a Final Fantasy XI joke)_
