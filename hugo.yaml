      This blog is my collection of personal writings going all the way back to 2012 when I left LiveJournal.
      I primarily write about technology, productivity, and ethics here.

      Now that I am posting a bit less on social media you can expect a lot more content here.
      It is still primarily just a blog but I am working to expand this into more of a full personal profile and site.

      Feel free to poke around and @ me on socials about anything you read.
      However, older content may not be something I identify with or endorse anymore.
